[__Klarenz__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Barlow) is a highly minimalist (the entire API consists of a single class `Part` and a main processor function `proc`!) and Pythonic package for compiling Lilypond sheet music.

# Packaging
Ensure to update the `src/klarenz/version.py` file and run `python prebuild.py` (and push them!) before initiating the build-upload process for each release.
