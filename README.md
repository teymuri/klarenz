[__Klarenz__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Barlow) is a very minimalist and _pythonistic_ (>= 3.5) package for compiling Lilypond sheet music.

Abjad requires Python 3.5 or later:

..  code-block::
    ~$ python --version
    Python 3.10.12

Abjad requires LilyPond 2.21.0 or later.
Make sure LilyPond is installed: http://lilypond.org/development.html
Make sure LilyPond is callable from the commandline:

..  code-block::
    $ lilypond --version
    GNU LilyPond 2.22.2

Create a Python 3 virtual environment for Abjad: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
Activate the virtual environment and then use pip to install Abjad:

..  code-block::
    ~$ python -m pip install abjad
